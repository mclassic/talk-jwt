# JWT Demo

This is a demo for a talk I'm giving on JSON Web Tokens.

The idea is that we'll register a user via the web app, then use that user's credentials to authenticate via API and
create a JWT in response.

We are using Laravel as the framework from which to build. Simply because the audience I'm giving this talk to is most
familiar with Laravel, and hey, I am too.
